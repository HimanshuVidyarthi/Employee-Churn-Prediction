Employee Promotion Prediction
This repository provides a machine learning solution for predicting employee promotions based on various performance and demographic factors. The project aims to support Human Resources (HR) teams in identifying employees likely to advance within the organization, thereby streamlining the promotion process and helping with workforce planning.

Project Overview
This project uses historical employee data to train a predictive model that identifies promotion eligibility. The model considers multiple features, including employee performance scores, department, length of service, and more.
